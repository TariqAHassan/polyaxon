Polyaxon allows users to manage all logs generated by jobs, builds, and experiments containers in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

## Create an Google cloud storage bucket

You should create a google cloud storage bucket (e.g. plx-data), and ensure the account that 
will be interacting with this bucket has the required read and write permissions. A key
for this account should be created and downloaded in JSON format. 

If you would like to create a dedicated service account, ensure that it is:

  * assigned a role that grants it read and write from google cloud storage
  * that the permissions on the bucket itself grant read and write to the service account.
    (Note that inherited permissions may not suffice and that a role with read and 
    write access may have to be assigned to account in the permissions of the bucket.)

Note: This is just a tutorial. Please consult with your devops team for
information on acceptable data permissions protocols at your organization
prior to deployment.

## Create a secret on Kubernetes

You should then create a secret with this access keys information on Kubernetes on the same namespace as Polyaxon deployment:

`kubectl create secret generic gcs-secret --from-file=gcs-secret.json=path/to/gcs-key.json -n polyaxon`

## Use the secret name and secret key in your logs persistence definition

```yaml
persistence:
  logs:
    store: gcs
    bucket: gs://[BUCKET-NAME]
    secret: [SECRET-NAME]
    secretKey: [SECRET-KEY]
```

e.g.

```yaml
persistence:
  logs:
    store: gcs
    bucket: gs://logs-bucket
    secret: gcs-secret
    secretKey: gcs-secret.json
```
